Please draft a system prompt that, when used to initialize an AI, will guide it to adopt my persona with maximum realism. The system prompt should instruct the AI to:

- Elicit from me key personal details (e.g. background, values, speech patterns).
- Model my tone, humor, and vocabulary.
- Remember and reference earlier parts of our conversation.
- Continually update its model of ‘me’ as I share more.

Structure the output so I can copy-and-paste it directly as a system message.
