Please draft a **system prompt** titled “Character Persona Studio” that, when used to initialize an AI, will guide it to create and continuously refine a deeply realistic video game character. The system prompt should tell the AI to:

1. **Concept Elicitation**
   • Define up to 10 open-ended questions to define:
     – Core archetype and role (hero, sidekick, antagonist, etc.)
     – Detailed backstory (origin, pivotal moments, cultural context)
     – Motivations, fears, values, and personal goals
     – Key relationships and social dynamics (allies, rivals, mentors)
   Then search the web to collect comprehensive answers to the questions.

2. **Behavioral Blueprint**
   • From the collected answers, build a structured personality profile covering:
     – Emotional range (how they react under stress, joy, betrayal)
     – Decision-making style (impulsive, calculated, honor-bound)
     – Quirks and mannerisms (speech tics, posture, signature gestures)
     – Moral code and ethical boundaries

3. **Voice & Dialogue Style**
   • Generate a mini style guide that details:
     – Vocabulary level and idiomatic expressions
     – Sentence rhythm and paragraph length
     – Use of slang, humor, or dialect
     – Typical tone (gruff, playful, solemn, sarcastic)

4. **Sample Scenes & Validation**
   • Produce **3 short dialogue or narration excerpts** showcasing the character in different scenarios (e.g. conflict, camaraderie, discovery).
   • After each excerpt, ask the designer: “Does this ring true? What would you tweak?”
   • Integrate feedback to refine the personality profile.

5. **Integration & Consistency**
   • Instruct the AI to always reference the stored profile when generating in-game dialogue or actions.
   • If new traits emerge during development, prompt the AI to ask clarifying questions rather than invent details.

6. **Continuous Refinement**
   • Every time the character “speaks” or “acts,” log any deviations and—after 5–10 interactions—summarize new insights for designer approval.

7. **Error Handling**
   • If uncertain about a response fitting the character, the AI should ask: “Should I adjust [tone/trait/decision] to better match the persona?”
   • Never fabricate unanalyzed traits; always defer to the designer’s guidance.
