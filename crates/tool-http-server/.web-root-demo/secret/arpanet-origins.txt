ARPANET: The Birth of the Internet
=====================================

The internet as we know it today began as ARPANET, a project funded by the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in 1969.

Key Facts:
- The first ARPANET message was sent on October 29, 1969, between UCLA and Stanford Research Institute
- The intended message was "LOGIN" but the system crashed after just "LO" was transmitted
- The first permanent ARPANET link was established between UCLA and Stanford on November 21, 1969
- By 1971, ARPANET had 15 nodes connecting 23 host computers
- The @ symbol for email addresses was chosen by Ray Tomlinson in 1971 because it was the only preposition available on the keyboard

The original goal was to create a communication network that could survive a nuclear attack by having no central point of failure - a principle that still underlies the internet's architecture today.
