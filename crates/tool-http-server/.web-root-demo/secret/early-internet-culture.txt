Early Internet Culture and Phenomena
====================================

The early internet had a unique culture that shaped how we communicate online today.

Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) Era (1970s-1990s):
- Before the internet, people connected to local BBS systems via dial-up modems
- Users would take turns calling in to leave messages and download files
- SysOps (System Operators) ran these boards from their homes
- Popular activities included text-based games, file sharing, and message forums

Early Internet Slang and Conventions:
- "TYPING IN ALL CAPS" was considered shouting (and still is!)
- Emoticons were invented in 1982 by Scott Fahlman: :-) and :-(
- The first internet meme was arguably the "dancing baby" in 1996
- "Flame wars" - heated arguments in discussion forums - got their name in the 1980s

Historic Internet Moments:
- The first spam email was sent by Gary Thuerk in 1978 to 393 ARPANET users
- The Morris Worm (1988) was the first major internet security incident, infecting 10% of internet-connected computers
- Usenet newsgroups created the first large-scale online communities
- AOL chat rooms popularized real-time online conversation for millions

Early Web Phenomena:
- GeoCities (1994) let anyone create a free website, leading to millions of amateur web pages
- The "Dancing Baby" became the first viral internet video in 1996
- ICQ introduced instant messaging with the iconic "Uh-oh!" sound in 1996
- Napster (1999) revolutionized file sharing and changed the music industry forever

These early internet experiences established many of the social norms and behaviors we still see online today.
