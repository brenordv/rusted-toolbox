The World's First Website
=========================

The very first website in history was created by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Switzerland.

Fascinating Details:
- URL: http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
- Went live on August 6, 1991
- The website explained what the World Wide Web was, how to use it, and how to set up a web server
- It was incredibly simple - just plain text with hyperlinks
- The original page contained instructions on how to search the web and was itself a directory of other websites

Historical Context:
- Tim Berners-Lee wrote the first web browser (called WorldWideWeb, later renamed Nexus) in 1990
- He also created the first web server software (httpd) and the first website
- The first web server ran on a NeXT computer at CERN
- Berners-Lee deliberately chose not to patent his invention, believing it should be free for everyone

The original website is still accessible today at CERN, preserved as a historical artifact of the digital age.
