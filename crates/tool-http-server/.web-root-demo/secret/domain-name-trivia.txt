Domain Name System: Interesting Facts
====================================

The Domain Name System (DNS) was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, but many fascinating stories surround early domain registrations.

Notable Domain Name Firsts:
- First registered domain: symbolics.com (March 15, 1985) - registered by Symbolics Inc., a computer manufacturer
- google.com was registered on September 15, 1997
- yahoo.com was registered on January 18, 1995
- amazon.com was registered on November 1, 1994

Quirky Domain Facts:
- The ".com" originally stood for "commercial" and was intended for commercial organizations
- The longest domain name ever registered was 63 characters long (the maximum allowed)
- There are over 1,500 different top-level domains (TLDs) as of 2023
- The most expensive domain ever sold was cars.com for $872 million in 2015

Early Internet Naming:
- Before DNS, computers were identified by numerical IP addresses
- A single file called HOSTS.TXT maintained by Stanford Research Institute listed all internet hosts
- This file had to be manually distributed to every computer on the network
- As the internet grew, this system became unsustainable, leading to the creation of DNS

The DNS system processes over 4.5 billion queries every day and is often called "the phone book of the internet."
