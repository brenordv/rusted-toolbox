The Great Browser Wars
======================

The evolution of web browsers is marked by fierce competition and rapid innovation.

First Generation Browsers:
- WorldWideWeb (1990) - The very first browser, created by Tim Berners-Lee
- Mosaic (1993) - The first graphical browser to gain widespread popularity
- Netscape Navigator (1994) - Dominated the market with 90% share by 1996

The First Browser War (1995-2001):
- Microsoft Internet Explorer vs. Netscape Navigator
- Microsoft bundled IE with Windows, leading to Netscape's decline
- IE peaked at 95% market share in 2003
- This led to the famous Microsoft antitrust case

Second Browser War (2004-2017):
- Mozilla Firefox (2004) introduced tabbed browsing and extensions
- Apple Safari (2003) optimized for Mac users
- Google Chrome (2008) revolutionized speed and minimalism
- Chrome quickly became dominant due to speed and integration with Google services

Interesting Browser Facts:
- The first browser to support CSS was Internet Explorer 3 in 1996
- Firefox was originally called Phoenix, then Firebird, before becoming Firefox
- Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine was so fast it changed web development forever
- The term "browser" was coined because early programs let you "browse" through files

Today, Chrome holds about 65% of the global browser market share, continuing the tradition of browser dominance shifts.
