                        <p>J.C.R. Licklider of MIT proposes the "Galactic Network" concept, envisioning a globally
                            interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data and
                            programs from any site.</p>

                            Corporation in Santa Monica via a 1200 bps phone line, proving the feasibility of wide-area

                            marks the true beginning of the Internet as we know it, with the first message sent being
                            "LO" (attempting to type "LOGIN").</p>

                            designate email addresses. This becomes one of the most transformative applications of the
                            early Internet.</p>

                            into TCP/IP. This protocol becomes the foundation for Internet communication worldwide.</p>
